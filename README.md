Digital System Design - Labs
Instructor: Deepak Dodeja, M.E, Sukkur IBA Universty
Course Description:
The course covers digital design topics such as digital logic, sequential building blocks, finite-state machines, FPGAs, timing and synchronization. The semester begins with lectures and problem sets, to introduce fundamental topics before students embark on lab assignments and ultimately, a digital design project. The course relies on extensive use of Verilog® for describing and implementing digital logic designs on FPGA development board.
